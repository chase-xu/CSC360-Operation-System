# CSC360 Operation System A1 Programming

This assignment(A1.c) is to implement a program that create a child with regular linux commands which are excuted by using execvp(). Once user typed bg followed with command, the program will create a child process and add the child process to a linklist which is used to check if it is terminated later. 
My code uses fgets() to get input from user, which means that I have changed the makefile inorder to run my code without a problem.
